# Watch Connectivity Framework Overview

**Watch Connectivity** is Apple’s high-level framework for transferring data and files between an iOS app and its paired watchOS app — abstracting underlying transport protocols and simplifying cross-device communication.  
It enables real-time messaging, background transfers, and app state synchronization with minimal overhead.

With Watch Connectivity, you can easily add:

- **Application Context** – Instantly synchronize the most recent app state using `updateApplicationContext(_:)`  
- **Interactive Messaging** – Send immediate messages with `sendMessage(_:replyHandler:errorHandler:)`, supporting optional replies  
- **Background Transfers with userInfo** – Queue background dictionary transfers using `transferUserInfo(_:)` for eventual delivery  
- **File Transfers** – Send larger assets like images or documents using `transferFile(_:metadata:)`, with metadata and progress tracking  
- **Session Management** – Activate communication via `WCSession.default.activate()`, and track state changes through `session(_:activationDidCompleteWith:)`  
- **Error Handling** – Handle size-limited messaging (~262 KB) and check for errors like `WCError.payloadTooLarge`

## Summary

- Watch Connectivity provides flexible, efficient mechanisms to synchronize state, exchange messages, transfer data dictionaries, and move files between iOS and watchOS apps seamlessly. 
- It abstracts transport details behind `WCSession` and offers specialized APIs for both interactive and background scenarios, making cross-device communication both reliable and performant.
